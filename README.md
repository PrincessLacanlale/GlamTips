# GlamTips
GlamTips web application is primarily built using JavaScript across both the frontend and backend, relying on Vue.js for the user interface and Node.js/Express.js to handle server logic and API communications. The application stores all its data, including services, staff, and bookings, in a MongoDB (NoSQL) database.
